The project gave me the opportunity to explore the full process of developing a fashion brand, from creative direction and brand identity to market research, data analysis, strategy, sourcing, production, and logistics. It strengthened my ability to think both creatively and analytically.",

              My experience includes working as a Merchandise Assistant to the

              Parsons Fashion Business Essentials course, and working as a
              sales associate for fashion companies. These experiences have
              allowed me to explore different sides of the industry while
              developing my understanding of merchandising, branding, customer
              experience, and the business behind fashion.
